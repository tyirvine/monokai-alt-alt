# Monokai Alt Alt
This theme is based on [Monokai Alt](https://github.com/sarcadass/vscode-monokai-alt). I cleaned it up a bit, removed the underlines and unified the design. The icons are from [Monokai Seti](https://github.com/adityavm/vscode-monokai-seti), which was the initial inspiration for all of this! Feel free to modify this theme and post a version of your own! 😊
